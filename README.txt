Version0 of Globlock. Source for Final Project: 4th Year as part of BSHCE4, with the National College of Ireland

Project Name: 
  Globlock

Project Title: 
  2 Factor Document Access control repository and file tokenization

Project Overview: 
  Globlock provides a document management system and file repository with 2 factor authentication, using open source hardware and software.

  A high level user can manage and control document revisions and access by grouping them into individual projects called 'Globes'.
 
  Each 'Globe' takes the abstract physical form of a 'Globe Object' with an embedded and unique RFID. 

  The entire system, using a robust centralised API, supports this document tokenisation and masks its underlying architecture from the user to provide a secure and streamlined file management access and repository solution.
  
Technologies Used: 
  RFID, Arduino, C++, C#, PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Apache
